    "This notebook reviews vector and matrix math, the [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/) Python package, and Python lambda expressions.  Part 1 covers vector and matrix math, and you'll do a few exercises by hand.  In Part 2, you'll learn about NumPy and use `ndarray` objects to solve the math exercises.   Part 3 provides additional information about NumPy and how it relates to array usage in Spark's [MLlib](https://spark.apache.org/mllib/).  Part 4 provides an overview of lambda expressions.\n",
    "\n",
    "To move through the notebook just run each of the cells.  You can run a cell by pressing \"shift-enter\", which will compute the current cell and advance to the next cell, or by clicking in a cell and pressing \"control-enter\", which will compute the current cell and remain in that cell.  You should move through the notebook from top to bottom and run all of the cells.  If you skip some cells, later cells might not work as expected.\n",
    "Note that there are several exercises within this notebook.  You will need to provide solutions for cells that start with: `# TODO: Replace <FILL IN> with appropriate code`.\n",

For example, `dataset.map(f1).filter(f2).reduce(f3)`, where `f1`, `f2`, and `f3` are functions or lambda expressions, first applies a map operation to `dataset`, then filters the result from map, and finally reduces the result from the first two operations.\n",
    "\n",
    " Note that when we compose (chain) an operation, the output of one operation becomes the input for the next operation, and operations are applied from left to right.  It's likely you've seen chaining used with Python strings.  For example, `'Split this'.lower().split(' ')` first returns a new string object `'split this'` and then `split(' ')` is called on that string to produce `['split', 'this']`.\n",
